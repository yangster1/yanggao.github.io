As co-president of the University of Alberta Nanorobotics team, I led the robot creation with superparamagnetic ferrofluid consisting of iron oxide nanopartciles.

The robot moves in the presence of a magnetic field. The droplet size is determined by injection volume, our 500 Âµm droplet equates to 100 nL of ferrofluid. This droplet can be manipulated to move in directions along the x and y axis under a magnetic field . The magnetic field is formed by  passing currents through four electromagnets. 
Arenas are microfabricated with silicon wafers, gold and photoresists.
